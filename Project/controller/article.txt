<u><b> How to grow strawberries</b></u><br>The best strawberries youâ€™ll ever taste will come from a garden, because fully ripened strawberries have a rich, aromatic flavour unmatched by their supermarket counterparts. Savoring the melt-in-your-mouth juiciness of freshly picked strawberries is but one reason to grow your own. As the first fruits to ripen in spring, strawberries are nutritious assets to any garden. The sturdy little plants prosper when planted in properly prepared beds or rows, or you can put them to work as edible edgings or let them sprawl over the top of a wall. Strawberries are happy to grow in strawberry jars and hanging baskets, too. For the very best results no matter where you plant them, start with vigorous young Leaf's strawberry plants.
